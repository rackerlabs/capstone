Entry points for `OpenStack Keystone <https://github.com/openstack/keystone>`_
in the Rackspace Public Cloud.

High-level architecture
-----------------------

The existing v2 identity system basically works like this:

   title v2 Authentication
   User->Java v2: v2 auth request
   Java v2->User: v2 auth response

Instead of impacting that system, we can build on top of it by deploying
keystone as a `reverse proxy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy>`_ to
the existing v2 identity system:

   title v3 Authentication
   User->Keystone v3: v3 auth request
   Keystone v3->Java v2: v2 auth request
   Java v2->Keystone v3: v2 auth response
   Keystone v3->User: v3 auth response

Design constraints
------------------

1. **Reliability.**

   - Keystone v3 should *never* impact the reliability of Rackspace v2 in any
     way.

   - Keystone v3 should regress gracefully when Rackspace v2 has outages,
     downtime, or inconsistent responses.

2. **Defcore-compliance.**

   - Keystone v3 must maintain complete Defcore compliance.

3. **Operational independence.**

   - Deploying Keystone v3 should not impact Rackspace v2 at all, or vice
     versa. You should be able to deploy new versions of either service
     independently of the other.

   - It should be trivial to vertically & horizontally scale as necessary.

4. **Seamless experience.**

   - Rackspace v2 is the single source of truth for authentication. Only
     Keystone v3-specific authorization data may live in Keystone.

5. **Performance.**

   - Keystone v3 should add minimal response time overhead to Rackspace v2.

Use cases
---------

1. **Create a token.** This is required for defcore compliance. The returned
   token must work with existing OpenStack services, which currently use v2 for
   token validation.

   The following authentication claims are expected to be supported by the v3
   API:

   - ``token``

   - ``password`` + ``user_id``

   - ``password`` + ``user_name`` + ``user_domain_id``

   - ``password`` + ``user_name`` + ``user_domain_name``

   The following authorization scopes are supported by the v3 API:

   - Unscoped, or automatically scoped to a preferred project

   - Project-scoped: ``project_id``

   - Project-scoped: ``project_name`` + ``project_domain_id``

   - Project-scoped: ``project_name`` + ``project_domain_name``

   - Domain-scoped: ``domain_id``

   - Domain-scoped: ``domain_name``

2. **Validate a token.** Rackspace public cloud should use v3 internally, and
   the first step is to allow them to validate user tokens against Keystone.

3. **User account management.** Users should be able to update their own
   password and change their username with the same user experience as the v2
   API.

4. **Delegation.** Users should be able to use v3 to delegate authorization to
   each other (trusts or otherwise).

Deployment
----------

Deployment tooling lives in the ``deploy/`` directory and uses `ansible
<https://www.ansible.com/>`_.

Prior to deploying capstone, specific upstream dependencies need to be
resolved. To resolve these using ``ansible-galaxy`` run the following::

    ansible-galaxy install --role-file=ansible-role-requirements.yml \
                           --ignore-errors --force

The ``deploy.yml`` playbook will expect an inventory file which will look
like::

    [keystone_all]
    <keystone_endpoint_ip_address>

The playbook will also expect us to provide a ``capstone.conf``::

    [service_admin]
    username = <username>
    password = <password>
    project_id = <project_id>

This account is provided by Rackspace. Once the ``capstone.conf`` and
``inventory`` files are in place we're ready to deploy::

    ansible-playbook -i inventory deploy.yml

Workflow
~~~~~~~~

The developer workflow mirrors that of OpenStack:

- Clone the repository: ``git clone git@github.com:rackerlabs/capstone.git &&
  cd capstone/``

- Setup ``git-review``: ``pip install --upgrade git-review && git review -s``

- Create a branch to work from, or go untracked: ``git checkout HEAD~0``

- Create a commit: ``git commit``.

  A ``Change-Id`` will be appended to your commit message to uniquely identify
  your code review.

- Upload it for review: ``git review``.

  You'll get a link to your code review on ``gerrithub.io``. A bot will then
  pull your change, run ``wercker build`` on it to test it, and upload the
  results back to gerrit, setting the ``Verified`` field to indicate build
  success or failure. If you have a Docker server available, you can run
  ``wercker build`` yourself using the `wercker CLI
  <https://github.com/wercker/wercker>`_.

- Your patch will be peer reviewed.

  If you need to upload a revision of your patch, fetch the latest patchset
  from gerrit using: ``git review -d <change-number>``, where your change
  number is NOT your ``Change-Id``, but instead is a unique number found in the
  URL of your code review.

- When your patch receives a +2 and is passing tests, it will be automatically
  merged.
