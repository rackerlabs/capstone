# This file contains all the variables to install capstone from a virtualenv.
# We can do this by installing capstone and it's dependencies into a virtual
# environment. Once everything is installed, we can tar up the venv and publish
# it somewhere that is reachable from production and staging. When we give
# os_keystone the download URL of the virtualenv it will unpack the virtualenv
# on the target system. This process takes care of installing capstone because
# it is included in the virtualenv, resulting in no additional plays for
# installing capstone. Everything leverages os_keystone to install capstone.
#
# Each variables in this file should be documented, having a reason why we need
# it for deploying capstone.

# keystone_venv_tag, keystone_venv_bin: Each virtualenv build with capstone and
# it's dependencies will have a sha, in the form of capstone-9e57f73. We need
# these in order to deploy specific version of capstone.
keystone_venv_tag: "{{ capstone_version }}"
keystone_venv_bin: "/openstack/venvs/keystone-{{ capstone_version }}/bin"

# keystone_venv_download_url: If installing from venvs, the os_keystone role
# requires a location to fetch venvs from. This url is built from inventory
# variables where venv_location is a server dedicated to serving out venvs and
# capstone_version is the version to deploy.
# Example: http://build-server.example.com/capstone/venv/capstone-9e57f73.tgz
keystone_venv_download_url: "{{ venv_location }}/{{ capstone_version }}.tgz"

# keystone_developer_mode: We must set this to false in order to install
# virtualenvs.
keystone_developer_mode: false

# keystone_requires_pip_packages: Since we're installing from venv, we don't
# need to include the full list of python packages required to install kesytone
# and capstone. We only require virtualenv-tools and httplib2 to fetch the venv
# and unpack it into the right place on the target system.
keystone_requires_pip_packages:
  - virtualenv-tools
  - httplib2

# pip_upstream_url, pip_global_conf_overrides: We need the ability to override
# these because we can't assume production and staging environments have access
# to the outside world. Instead, these should resolve to appropriate internal
# mirrors.
